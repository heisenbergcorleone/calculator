# calculator
Hi there! Calculator 1.0 is written in vanilla JS and is still under construction. The calculator currently works on a keypad, and allows 
the users to change math operators just by pressing the new(correct) one (without deleting the previous one). Still users can use
the backspace key to delete numbers. The enter key is also provided which works exactly as math operators but just displays the answer. 
Hope you like it :) Cheers!
